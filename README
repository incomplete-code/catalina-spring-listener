# README - catalina spring listener

###

this project is to create a hook between Tomcat and Spring to allow the startup and shutdown of
infrastructure resources inside a Tomcat container.  

THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO SUPPORT TESTING

scenario: i want to deploy two WARs to a comtact container for testing purposes.  these apps share
a JMS infrastructure.

ActiveMQ VM connectors don't work due to the following;
- startup order
- application assumes responsibility for establishing infrastructure and most be removed during prod
- establishment of configuration can be a 'challenge' and subject to order

solution: add a startup hook in tomcat to establish shared infrastructure such as;
- JMS provider (AMQ)
- Database provider (SQL)
- cache infrastructure (GemFire)
